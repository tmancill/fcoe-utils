                  FCoE Management Tools Installation Guide
                  ========================================

The FCoE Management Tools included in this package are

        fcoeadm - program to create, reset, destroy, and display FCoE interfaces
        fcoemon - program to monitor the events from the DCB daemon

Requirements:

        The HBAAPI library and the HBAAPI vendor library source must be built
and installed before you can build the management tools. Both the HBAAPI library,
libHBAAPI, and the HBAAPI vendor library, libhbalinux, may be downloaded from
www.Open-FCoE.org. The instructions in the package describe how to download and
build the libraries.

Best Practices :

Any newly discovered disk can be mounted using udev rules, autofs and possibly by
other methods as needed. However, if a fcoe disk is needed by any other system service
that follows the fcoe service then the disk will need to be mounted at some point
after the fcoe service, but before the service that requires the disk. That mounting
could possibly be added to the fcoe service script itself, or to a new service script
that would run after fcoe, but before the script that requires the fcoe disk.
The following is an example of how to mount a fcoe disk formatted with an ext3 file
system using /etc/fstab.

	mount_fcoe_disks_from_fstab()
	{
	    local timeout=20
	    local done=1
	    local fcoe_disks=($(egrep 'by-path\/fc-.*_netdev' /etc/fstab | cut -d ' ' -f1))

	    test -z $fcoe_disks && return 0

	    echo -n "Waiting for fcoe disks . "
	    while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do
		for disk in ${fcoe_disks[*]}; do
			if ! test -b $disk; then
				done=0
				break
			fi
		done

		test $done -eq 1 && break;
		sleep 1
		echo -n ". "
		done=1
		let timeout--
	    done

	    if test $timeout -eq 0; then
		echo "timeout!"
	    else
		echo "done!"
	    fi

	    # mount any newly discovered disk
	    mount -a 2>/dev/null
	}

	The mount_fcoe_disks_from_fstab function should be invoked after the
fcoemon daemon is started by the fcoe service script to mount any fcoe disk
specified by path in /etc/fstab as:-

	/dev/disk/by-path/fc-0xXX:0xXX /mnt/fcoe-disk1 ext3  defaults,_netdev    0 0
	/dev/disk/by-path/fc-0xYY:0xYY /mnt/fcoe-disk2 ext3  defaults,_netdev    0 0

	The /dev/disk/by-path entries with "fc-" and "_netdev" in their names
enables mount_fcoe_disks_from_fstab to identify the fcoe disks so that it can
wait for the fcoe disks to be discovered. If they are not added to the system
within the timeout period the function will exit, the timeout is set to 20
seconds but can be changed to suit the environment. See man fstab(5) for for
more details on mounting filesystems.
