DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *fcoeadm* utility is the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) management
tool for the _Open-FCoE_ project.  *fcoeadm* may be used to create,
destroy, and reset an FCoE instance on a given network interface. For these
operations *fcoeadm* sends a command to a running *fcoemon* process, via a
socket interface. *fcoemon* will then perform the requested operation.

*fcoeadm* also provides operations to query information about FCoE instances,
including interface information, target information, LUN information, and port
statistics. For much of this information, *fcoeadm* relies on the _libhbalinux_
implementation of the _HBA API_. Only one operation may be given on a
command.

OPTIONS
-------
*-m*, *--mode* fabric|vn2vn::
	Used together with the create option to control the FCoE mode of
	operation. The mode defaults to fabric but this option allows
	the selection of vn2vn mode.

OPERATIONS
----------
*-c*, *--create* _ethX_::
	Creates an FCoE instance based on the specified network interface.
	Note that if there is not an fcoemon configuration file for the
	interface (/etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX, see *fcoemon*), then the created
	FCoE instance will not require DCB.

*-d*, *--destroy* _ethX_::
	Destroys the FCoE instance on the specified network interface. This
	will not destroy FCoE instances created by fipvlan.

*-r*, *--reset* _ethX_::
	Resets the FCoE instance on the specified network interface. This
	will not reset FCoE instances created by fipvlan.

*-S*, *--Scan* _ethX_::
	Rescan for new targets and LUNs on the provided instance. This
	command will not rescan any NPIV instances created on the same port.
	This will not rescan any FCoE instance created by fipvlan.

*-i*, *--interface* [_ethX_]::
	Show information about the FCoE instance on the specified network
	interface, or all FCoE instances if no network interface is specified.

*-f*, *--fcfs* [_ethX_]::
	Show information about the discovered Fibre Channel Forwarders (FCFs)
	on the specified network interface, or all discovered FCFs if no
	network interface is specified.

*-t*, *--target* [_ethX_]::
	Show information about the discovered targets associated with the
	FCoE instance on the specified network interface.
	If no network interface is specified, information about discovered
	targets from all FCoE instances will be shown.

*-l*, *--lun* [_ethX_]::
	Show detailed information about the discovered SCSI LUNs associated
	with the FCoE instance on the specified network interface.
	If no network interface is specified, information about SCSI LUNs
	from all FCoE instances will be shown.

*-s*, *--stats* _ethX_ [_interval_]::
	Show the statistics (including FC4 statistics) of the FCoE
	connection on the specified network interface. The information will
	be displayed repeatedly until the user cancels the command. The
	statistics will be printed every specified _interval_ (in seconds).
	_interval_ should be specified as a whole number greater than 0.
	If _interval_ is not specified, a default interval of one second is
	used.

*-b*, *--lesb* _ethX_ [_interval_]::
	Show the Link Error Statistics Block (LESB) of the FCoE connection
	on the specified network interface. The information will be displayed
	repeatedly until the user cancels the command. The LESB statistics
	will be printed every specified _interval_ (in seconds). _interval_
	should be specified in whole integers greater than 0. If the
	_interval_ is not specified, a default interval of one second is used.

*-h*, *--help*::
	Displays the usage message of the *fcoeadm* command.

*-v*, *--version*::
	Displays the version of the *fcoeadm* command.

INTERFACE NAMES
---------------
The actual name for _ethX_ depends on the *AUTO_VLAN* setting in the fcoemon
interface configuration (/etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX, see *fcoemon*).

If *AUTO_VLAN* is set to _yes_, the interface name _ethX_ references the
network device itself. If *AUTO_VLAN* is set to _no_, the interface
name _ethX_ references the VLAN device.

EXAMPLES
--------
Creates an FCoE instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -c eth2.101

Creates an FCoE VN2VN instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -m vn2vn -c eth2.101

Destroys the FCoE instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -d eth2.101

Resets the FCoE instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -r eth2.101

Show the information of all the adapters and their ports having FCoE
instances created

	fcoeadm -i

Show the information of all FCoE instances on interface eth3.

	fcoeadm -i eth3

Show the information of all the discovered targets from all the ports
having FCoE instances created (they may be on different adapter cards).
A brief listing of discovered LUNs are listed after the target they are
associated with, if any

	fcoeadm -t

Show the information of all the discovered targets from a given port (eth3)
having FCoE instance created. A brief listing of discovered LUNs are listed
after each target they are associated with, if any

	fcoeadm -t eth3

Show the detailed information of all the LUNs discovered on all FCoE
connections

	fcoeadm -l

Show the detailed information of all the LUNs associated with a specific
interface

	fcoeadm -l eth3.101

Show the statistics information of a specific port eth3 having FCoE
instances created. The statistics are displayed one line per time interval.
The default interval is one second if an interval is not specified

	fcoeadm -s eth3

	fcoeadm -s eth3 3
